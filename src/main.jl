        A random number from 0 to 1000 is generated
        The function returns as true if the random number is smaller than the result of the function
        The function is hill shaped(flipped parabloa). Its roots are on x=0 and x=24 and the peak is at x=12
        The highest point is y=144.
        Because the random number is between 0 and 1000 there is a maximal chance of 15% to return true at 12:00 to 12:59 (15% each Minute)
